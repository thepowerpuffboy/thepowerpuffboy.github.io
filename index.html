          <div class="story"><p><em>Pirates MC's one of the earliest 1 %er motorbike club in United States which was formed in to late sixties or maybe earlier. 
            Details on club's founding story still remains unclear due to code of secrecy within the club members. Jim Bradley one of the directors of the TV 
            show 'Gangland' and expert in the field claims origin of the MC might have been just like the origin of most of the outlaw bikers MC out there, at 
            the end of the world war. Quoting his words 'Couple of hot headed american's returns home, all they could do was ride motorbikes and kill some communists. 
            Loves to fuck women and do booze due to unavailability of women in their previous line of work, forms brotherhood with people with similar interests. 
            Can't do normal work to earn cash to keep those lavish lives, goes on to path of crime. It was easy to form such groups in those times due to high number 
            of home returned soldiers, later on people were just impressed by air of power and authority they had around them and went to any limits just to be one of 
            them.' Earliest origin of the Pirates can be traced into possibly into San Jiardiano, CA, and the infamous crime spree of hijacking Government trucks by 
            several riders on Harley Davidson's. It's one of the Possibility that earned him their name 'Pirates', still that's just a rumor. Well known 'Pirates' 
            fronts are </em></p></div>
      
      <div class="story"><p><em>There has been no successful conviction made on 'Pirates' till date. Although there has been several personal conviction of pirate 
        members for charges of vandalism, traffic violations, rioting, extortion, arms/narcotics dealing, and a few cases of 1st degree murders too. Several 'Pirates' 
        club charters are also to be crime scenes of bar brawls and several other felonies but there's always lack of evidence when it comes of convicting 'Pirates' 
        as a crime organization. For the outer world pirates is just a club of motorcycle enthusiasts who drinks and rides together and wears their vests just as a 
        feeling of a brotherhood. Several myths regarding pirates establishes their image as modern day 'Robin Hoods'. They rob from the rich to give the poor although 
        those are just legends and myths, there has been no proof of them actually performing any deeds as a part of an organization. 'Pirates' are said to be providing 
        protection to cargo on road travels, providing repossession services, and running a garage. Illegal part of their gang moving and supplying narcotics and weapons, 
        extorting business owners for 'Pirates' themselves or for other organizations, vandalism's on Government properties and their rival's properties, it's also said 
        that any member of the 'Pirates' can and will go to any limits just for the sake of the reputation and secrecy of the club and it's activities, which also may 
        performing murder or beating the shit out of anyone brutally. There has been no sources any law enforcement or TV shows operative are able to get even as anonymous 
        source who will provide information of the club. There has been no official 'retired Pirates member' coming into limelight so all of them are probably in for the 
        life or just too afraid to go public. There has been an on-going investigation against 'Pirates' charter in North Canada for the brutal confrontation resulting in 
        several injured and killed members of the fellow MC charter 'Road Rippers' of the similar city. The known hangouts for 'Pirates' is their clubhouse and their garage. 
        They also own a punk-rock record label named 'Headbangers records co.' which is a rising name in the music industries nowadays, operating from New York City 
        as it's base.</em></p></div>

      <div class="story"><p><em>Nevada charter, located on the Western Las Vegas had several fatal blows dealing with their constant rivalry of Greaseballs MC- which later 
        on resulted into an open all out war. The war was won but the charter had bestowed with severe losses of members, resources, and continuous attempts of local law 
        enforcement combined with ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) resulted into charter to fall. The club being originated from East Coast, couldn't 
        afford to keep their one of the few and important charter on the West Coast down like that, hence they sent out one of the existing Road Captain(s) of the Mother 
        Charter, along with a team to the West. They approved them as the NOMAD charter operating for the states of California and Nevada.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="story"><p><em>On the arrival, Dexter learned the fact- it was going to be a lot more harder to set up his camp in the Vegas with the suddenly increased 
        crime rate, and being a tourist town- higher awareness of the law enforcement. The constant crosshairs of ATF aimed at the club, Dexter packed his bags and decided 
        to change his base to Los Angeles. He took an old Car Wash place in Watts on lease and started off from there. Car Wash was just merely a laying low spot for the Dexter 
        and the remnant of the Nevada charter.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="story"><p><em>Pirates being formed of mixed up bunch of, several individuals being fully white supremacists, and several just hateful towards African 
        Americans, it wasn't too easy for them to settle down in Watts. Dexter himself had never been a white supremacist nor a supporter, yet the amount of racist people in 
        the club kept Hispanic males in lower quantity and African Americans at bay from joining the club. This caused a lot of skirmishes with local residents and gang-members 
        while Pirates was in Watts. This resulted into a lot of streetfights, stabbing and robbing on the both sides. The club had friends in White Aryan Resistance, spread 
        through out the Correctional Facilities of the country. That included one of the founding member Richard 'Grease' McCleary, who is a commonly seen face around the club 
        during his parole times.</em></p></div>

      <div class="story"><p><em>The continuous skirmishes with blacks, led Pirates to increasing their strength by getting their hands on some serious firepower. Those constant 
        scrimmages, put Pirates in touch with an Assyrian operative named Andre Badal who was representing one of the biggest arm suppliers racket in the state. For a brief moment, 
        Pirates had truce with one of the largest gang operating in the Watts, East Side Black Disciples- headed by Treshawn Brown. This was about pushing Pirates product on to 
        street, having equal cut on the profit and maintaining the neighborhood's peace. All the smaller gangs, and wanna be gangbangers used to respect ESBD then, and stayed back 
        either out of respect or fear. However a SWAT raid led by Captain Samuel Hunt, shut down their operation in the Watts and vicinity of MacArthur Park/Echo Park. This resulted 
        into incarnation of Treshawn Brown and all of his top OGs. ESBD being out of the picture, everyone wanted to claim that crown for themselves. All hell broke loose, and Pirates 
        were forced into inter-gang conflicts without their consent. Dexter used to supply several Corleone Crime Family, then associates including Nigel Fisher, Daniel Carter, 
        Perry Smith, Francesco Casalesi with the guns, at very low profit as a goodwill gesture of the friendship of Carter and Dexter's Sergeant At Arms Asher Westbrook from their 
        time in service together at Special Forces.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="story"><p><em>This led to several causalities on the enemy sides, and a lot of brothers getting injured brutally. It was really a hard time for the club. 
        A member couldn't ride colours in the Watts. Some black SUV will pull up behind any random Harley rider- and just riddle his body with KG9s and UZI micro SMGs. 
        Against those barbaric ways, club was trying their best to survive with a little to no firepower. The Berettas and Glocks provided by the Badal was no good against that. 
        This led the club to explore other options and re-think their at then moment status in the state.</em></p></div>

      <div class="story"><p><em>While looking for a way to get more money, and pull the club out of the Watts and re-locate, the then Vice President Samuel 'Dodger' Coleman decided 
        to get in touch with some of his old contacts and start up production of Methamphetamine. Dexter got Coleman a place in the Shady Creeks, Angel Pine forests below Mount Diablo. 
        They started up the production on small scale in one of the abandoned cabin. They stashed the prepared product into an auto shop owned by Club's friend. The product would then 
        be transferred to the city. This was one very dangerous operation but yet, Club had to take the risk. This was a bad idea since the start and club had to pay heavily for it. 
        This led to Dodger getting busted by Sheriffs while in possession of half a kilogram of narcotics substances. This was a felony and major parole violation for him, and hence 
        he got locked up for the remaining 15 years of his time.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="story"><p><em>Dexter grew close with Eric Villain, one of the known Hispanic gang leader, operating from 103rd St. Inglewood. The gang was known as 103rd Rascals, 
        Inglewood. Dexter helped out them in a growing brawl with one of the African American gang lifting their head in the near by neighborhood Compton. Later on when some Irish 
        drug dealers tried to lay their foot in the drug trade, Pirates had threatened them to back down- which led them to kidnap one of the club's Prospect. Raskals and the Pirates 
        worked together in the process of liberating the Prospect- gunning down four of the Irish dealers.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="story"><p><em>A while after that, a rival MC riding by the name of Warlocks tried to fly colours in the Los Angeles. This led to Dexter personally stabbing one of 
        the Sergeant At Arms of the MC- and claiming his cut from him. That was the first event when Pirates have been territorial about the city, giving the signal of them going to 
        settle down as a full fledged California and Nevada charter eventually. Old Road Captain Jim Sturges was placed in charge of the second in command of the club in Dodger's 
        absence.</em></p></div>

      <div class="story"><p><em>Dexter had managed to invest his money on a large chunk of property in middle of the city on Olvera Street just down the intersection of Union Station, 
        El Serena and Inglewood. The property was placed under renovation and re-decorated according to the Club's taste. Dexter had received custody of his daughter Lana due to untimely 
        death of his ex-wife and Lana's mother. She was staying around with the Club, getting familiar with the members and getting used to the environment specifically. The club was then 
        introduced to Fabrizio Cavalante, then owner of a club on the corner of Pershing Square. Fabrizio put the club in touch with his rest of the business associates in the arms trade. 
        Henry Barzini and Raymond Aprille. Raymond Aprille started managing most of the trades with club, and grew pretty close with the MC.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="story"><p><em>Raymond was a frequent face around the club then. Raymond put club in touch with a member of a white supremacist cult led by two brothers Theodore Bagwell 
        and Paul Bagwell in the same city. Lana almost blossoming into her womanhood, was taken and abducted by Theodore Bagwell, violated and abused. This escalated things for the MC 
        being a calm and easy going passive member of the city. That particular event turned a lot of domino's, triggering a chain of events including arson of the main bank, brutal murder 
        and the body being dumped in the public with dick attached to one of the cult's member's head, eventual arson of the cabin that served home to the cult for their invidious activities. 
        The cult was tightly affiliated with Tattaglia Crime Family. Those events led cult to react back, abduct Dexter and Lana from a wide active morning from the bank. Later on a Police Officer, 
        A rival mafia family member, and three of the cult members were found dead on the bridge joining Hollywood Hills and Bel Air. It was the day when a lot of things changed for Lana, Dexter 
        and the MC. Dexter had almost lost his eye-sight of his right eye totally if it wasn't for the modern medical science. It was the day Lana had finally accepted the club as the good guys 
        lifting guns for the correct purpose, it was the day when she had lifted gun and performed act of murder herself, it was the day when Lana was finally liberated from the fear of Bagwell. 
        It was the day when that cult was put to an end after the brutal death of the leaders. This was the day when it was all escalated totally for the club, Pirates was now a known name around- 
        and a lot of beliefs of the people affiliated willingly or were forced to get involved unwillingly, turned upside down.</em></p></div>

         invited to this grand opening of the clubhouse and the garage around the rear known as V-TWIN Automotives. Jackson 'Hawk' Connoly was then named the new Road Captain of the club, placed 
         in charge of the V-TWIN and the maintenance of all the members' bikes and vehicles. Boxing and wrestling was a big thing around the Pirates member, spending hours on the weight bench 
         flexing their huge biceps was fourth thing that came to their schedule after riding, fucking and drinking. The clubhouse had it's very own ring in the backyard, along with several 
         benches.</em></p></div>

       <div class="story"><p><em>The auto shop led the club to meet two new presence in the town, of La Mirada 37, operating from apartment blocks of El Serena and some more Irish people. 
         Martinez DeMarco, in charge of the La Mirada 37 along with his several DeMarco siblings grew close with the club as well. They were frequent faces around the clubhouse. However, 
         the Irish wanted the Jackson dead for some reasons. They tried to negotiate a deal with Vice President Sturges. The failed negotiation led the Irish to bomb the clubhouse, and shut 
         it down once again. Pirates saw this as a personal blow at them- and retaliated leaving three of the Irish good dead by the Santa Maria lighthouse in attempt of leaving the city 
         via the boat. This war had costed club and La Mirada a lot of money and moreover life of a La Mirada gang member. This situation with Irish sealed the bond with La Mirada and Pirates. 
         The Pirates had to fall back to their old home in Watts, until the investigation and insurance formalities were over in their just newly formed clubhouse. Once the Pirates were back, 
         Dexter applied for the Government Maintenance Contracts for the vehicles owned by Los Santos Police Department, and successfully won the tender for the contract for the V-TWIN.</em></p></div>

       <div class="story"><p><em>Things were going great for the Pirates. Everything was just too easy. Just about when Dexter thought the bumpy ride was over and they were settling down after all, 
         his one of the brother was abducted by La Mirada. This sent Dexter out raging. Dexter tried to get some help from his old friends in Corleone Family, who now were rised up in their ranks and 
         pretty respectful people in the family. Dexter along with a crew of Corleone hitsquad went for La Mirada's blocks in El Serena. Martinez failed to reason with Dexter and come clear about the 
         situation, which led Dexter to shoot one of DeMarco brother dead on scene- right in Martinez's face. This broke into an all out brawl between Dexter and Martinez- resulting into several 
         associates from the both sides joining in. However, one of the gangbangers pulled out a weapon and discharged it-resulting into everyone to go for their arms and turn the brawl of fists into 
         a murder show. That thing ended with brutal execution of the participants from La Mirada, and almost no causality on the side of the MC or Corleone. Eventually MC got into gun trade with 
         Francesco Casalesi, one of the Corleone Soldier on a much more larger scale.</em></p></div>
      
       <div class="story"><p><em>A recent bar brawl confirms presence of the Pirates and Dexter himself, behind the thrashing of a bar at the end of the party. Sources claims an African American male 
         Franklin Crooker working then for All Saints General provoked the MC into a fist fight- eventually breaking into a helter-skelter all out bar brawl. The investigation and the charges on the club 
         members are yet pending. The club was said to be organized by associates of Irish Republican Army- the very same for whom MC was providing road securities to cargos on the highways of the state. 
         The Triangle Club was shut down for the renovation purpose for a good long week. That shows the potential of MC to cause damage, even without any sort of weapons.</em></p></div>
       
       <div class="story"><p><em>Jackson Pearce, one of the Tattaglia Crime Family Captain was got into affiliation with the club on one of the underground wrestling tournaments and betting hosted by 
         the MC. Jackson being a fighter himself and having a keep interest in illegal brawling, participated and won against the Road Captain. Jackson was a frequent ring fighter until he faced the 
         big man himself in the ring. Dexter without letting Jackson land a punch- K.O'ed him. This, led Jackson to grow respect for Dexter and the MC turning him into another frequent face around the 
         clubhouse. After several visits, Jackson asked Dexter for a favour- to take care of the remnant of the La Mirada members, getting onto his nerves by tagging and vandalizing on his turf. This 
         led to MC and the Jackson's associate work in a combined effort and burning down the rest of the block left untouched in the last skirmish of the MC with Mirada.</em></p></div>

      <div class="story"><p><em>Dexter had pushed the narcotics out of the club's system, yet it was some really good money. Dodger during a prison meeting time- left Dexter with a tip off on a cargo 
        leaving one of the chemical factories in Fort Carson, with not so legal stuff. This led Dexter to intercept it by a broken bridge with MC members and rob the cargo. This led the club back into 
        the manufacturing of Methamphetamine. A Russian guy with severe brain damage issues, was abducted and hollered to the set up in the woods from the Dodger's time. Later on it was discovered, he 
        was more than willing to cook meth and do it for the rest of his life- without getting paid or threatened. The produced product was shipped down the south border to the Mexico, since Dexter did 
        not want to take any risk of keeping or dealing the product again, since it was pretty ugly the last time.</em></p></div>
      
       <div class="story"><p><em>The Pirates were said to have a major part in the series of looting taken place around the ruins of nutrition depot and firing range of the Special Forces base in 
         Ocean Docks, when Korean attack took place on it.</em></p></div>
      
       <div class="story"><p><em>The Vice President Jim Sturges was served warrant for one of the crimes of his past- resulting him to thrown in jail for the charges of attempted murder. Asher was put 
         in the VP's chair, along with Tucker Manson in the right chair of Sergeant and Marcus Lennon in Road Captain's chair. There was no provision of parole, since the crime involved the victim being 
         an underage- however the amount of time investigation took and under the reasons of good behavior the Club put in request of parole for Jim. 
         The hearing is due regarding that.....(to be continued)</em></p></div>

       <div class="story"><p><em>During late 2013, Dexter got elected as the National President. He left the helm of ship to Todd McKurdie and let him become the President for the state of San Andreas. 
         This went well for a short while, but lack of tight grip of authority over the business led to MC starting to slack off. Increasing amount of rivals and pressure from authority reached the nexus 
         point when they started breaking down onto the club businesses. Not a single week passed by that came with news of ATF raiding a club location of interest with help of local SOB, or a rival 
         organization put club out of business. The club started losing their influence and their turf rapidly. Eventually the club was sidelined in their own state by others. Remnant of the club moved 
         out into county sides with whatever was left of them. The basic organization of the club broke down and all that was left over was broken links of a chains broken apart that once used to be as 
         strong as the chain of a Harley. Dexter too busy with his work on national scene and even with a few chapters opening onto international soil had let this slip completely out of his mind.

       <div class="story"><p><em>Realizing how bad it went for club in his state of San Andreas, Dexter rode back into state and got in touch with the leftover members taking refuge in the county side. 
         Dexter and his troop of a few rallied back into the city and re-acquired the clubhouse that now was abandoned pile of shit and home of junkies and homeless. A quick renovation took place by the 
         club members to make the place habitable again. More members came along from different chapters too to help Pirates claim the roads back which once belonged to them solely. (To be continued).
