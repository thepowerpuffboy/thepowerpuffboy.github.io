        <p id="first-para">I started a night guard job in an office complex so I could study and practice programming while working. I enjoy the work as it doesn't requires much from me and I get to spend at least six hours a night learning new skills while being paid for sitting on my butt.</p>
        
        <p id="second-para">At first I began learning some Java basics untill at some point I got overwhelmed by the ammount of math you have to do in this language, so I decided to move on to a different language and perhaps come back to it when I am more prepared for that challange.</p>
        
        <p id="third-para">The language I decided to learn is HTML & CSS as I been familiar already with that concept from the times I been writing on various forums that required using similar concept.</p>
        <p id="forth-para">I am very happy now that I managed to find a way to increase my productivity and found a job that fits me for this time.</p>
