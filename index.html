          <div class="prologue"><p><em>Pirates MC's one of the earliest 1 %er motorbike club in United States which was formed in to late sixties or maybe earlier. 
            Details on club's founding story still remains unclear due to code of secrecy within the club members. Jim Bradley one of the directors of the TV 
            show 'Gangland' and expert in the field claims origin of the MC might have been just like the origin of most of the outlaw bikers MC out there, at 
            the end of the world war. Quoting his words 'Couple of hot headed american's returns home, all they could do was ride motorbikes and kill some communists. 
            Loves to fuck women and do booze due to unavailability of women in their previous line of work, forms brotherhood with people with similar interests. 
            Can't do normal work to earn cash to keep those lavish lives, goes on to path of crime. It was easy to form such groups in those times due to high number 
            of home returned soldiers, later on people were just impressed by air of power and authority they had around them and went to any limits just to be one of 
            them.' Earliest origin of the Pirates can be traced into possibly into San Jiardiano, CA, and the infamous crime spree of hijacking Government trucks by 
            several riders on Harley Davidson's. It's one of the Possibility that earned him their name 'Pirates', still that's just a rumor. Well known 'Pirates' 
            fronts are </em></p></div>
      
      <div class="prologue"><p><em>There has been no successful conviction made on 'Pirates' till date. Although there has been several personal conviction of pirate 
        members for charges of vandalism, traffic violations, rioting, extortion, arms/narcotics dealing, and a few cases of 1st degree murders too. Several 'Pirates' 
        club charters are also to be crime scenes of bar brawls and several other felonies but there's always lack of evidence when it comes of convicting 'Pirates' 
        as a crime organization. For the outer world pirates is just a club of motorcycle enthusiasts who drinks and rides together and wears their vests just as a 
        feeling of a brotherhood. Several myths regarding pirates establishes their image as modern day 'Robin Hoods'. They rob from the rich to give the poor although 
        those are just legends and myths, there has been no proof of them actually performing any deeds as a part of an organization. 'Pirates' are said to be providing 
        protection to cargo on road travels, providing repossession services, and running a garage. Illegal part of their gang moving and supplying narcotics and weapons, 
        extorting business owners for 'Pirates' themselves or for other organizations, vandalism's on Government properties and their rival's properties, it's also said 
        that any member of the 'Pirates' can and will go to any limits just for the sake of the reputation and secrecy of the club and it's activities, which also may 
        performing murder or beating the shit out of anyone brutally. There has been no sources any law enforcement or TV shows operative are able to get even as anonymous 
        source who will provide information of the club. There has been no official 'retired Pirates member' coming into limelight so all of them are probably in for the 
        life or just too afraid to go public. There has been an on-going investigation against 'Pirates' charter in North Canada for the brutal confrontation resulting in 
        several injured and killed members of the fellow MC charter 'Road Rippers' of the similar city. The known hangouts for 'Pirates' is their clubhouse and their garage. 
        They also own a punk-rock record label named 'Headbangers records co.' which is a rising name in the music industries nowadays, operating from New York City 
        as it's base.</em></p></div>

      <div class="season1"><p><em>Nevada charter, located on the Western Las Vegas had several fatal blows dealing with their constant rivalry of Greaseballs MC- which later 
        on resulted into an open all out war. The war was won but the charter had bestowed with severe losses of members, resources, and continuous attempts of local law 
        enforcement combined with ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) resulted into charter to fall. The club being originated from East Coast, couldn't 
        afford to keep their one of the few and important charter on the West Coast down like that, hence they sent out one of the existing Road Captain(s) of the Mother 
        Charter, along with a team to the West. They approved them as the NOMAD charter operating for the states of California and Nevada.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="season1"><p><em>On the arrival, Dexter learned the fact- it was going to be a lot more harder to set up his camp in the Vegas with the suddenly increased 
        crime rate, and being a tourist town- higher awareness of the law enforcement. The constant crosshairs of ATF aimed at the club, Dexter packed his bags and decided 
        to change his base to Los Angeles. He took an old Car Wash place in Watts on lease and started off from there. Car Wash was just merely a laying low spot for the Dexter 
        and the remnant of the Nevada charter.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="season1"><p><em>Pirates being formed of mixed up bunch of, several individuals being fully white supremacists, and several just hateful towards African 
        Americans, it wasn't too easy for them to settle down in Watts. Dexter himself had never been a white supremacist nor a supporter, yet the amount of racist people in 
        the club kept Hispanic males in lower quantity and African Americans at bay from joining the club. This caused a lot of skirmishes with local residents and gang-members 
        while Pirates was in Watts. This resulted into a lot of streetfights, stabbing and robbing on the both sides. The club had friends in White Aryan Resistance, spread 
        through out the Correctional Facilities of the country. That included one of the founding member Richard 'Grease' McCleary, who is a commonly seen face around the club 
        during his parole times.</em></p></div>

      <div class="season2"><p><em>The continuous skirmishes with blacks, led Pirates to increasing their strength by getting their hands on some serious firepower. Those constant 
        scrimmages, put Pirates in touch with an Assyrian operative named Andre Badal who was representing one of the biggest arm suppliers racket in the state. For a brief moment, 
        Pirates had truce with one of the largest gang operating in the Watts, East Side Black Disciples- headed by Treshawn Brown. This was about pushing Pirates product on to 
        street, having equal cut on the profit and maintaining the neighborhood's peace. All the smaller gangs, and wanna be gangbangers used to respect ESBD then, and stayed back 
        either out of respect or fear. However a SWAT raid led by Captain Samuel Hunt, shut down their operation in the Watts and vicinity of MacArthur Park/Echo Park. This resulted 
        into incarnation of Treshawn Brown and all of his top OGs. ESBD being out of the picture, everyone wanted to claim that crown for themselves. All hell broke loose, and Pirates 
        were forced into inter-gang conflicts without their consent. Dexter used to supply several Corleone Crime Family, then associates including Nigel Fisher, Daniel Carter, 
        Perry Smith, Francesco Casalesi with the guns, at very low profit as a goodwill gesture of the friendship of Carter and Dexter's Sergeant At Arms Asher Westbrook from their 
        time in service together at Special Forces.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="season2"><p><em>This led to several causalities on the enemy sides, and a lot of brothers getting injured brutally. It was really a hard time for the club. 
        A member couldn't ride colours in the Watts. Some black SUV will pull up behind any random Harley rider- and just riddle his body with KG9s and UZI micro SMGs. 
        Against those barbaric ways, club was trying their best to survive with a little to no firepower. The Berettas and Glocks provided by the Badal was no good against that. 
        This led the club to explore other options and re-think their at then moment status in the state.</em></p></div>

      <div class="season3"><p><em>While looking for a way to get more money, and pull the club out of the Watts and re-locate, the then Vice President Samuel 'Dodger' Coleman decided 
        to get in touch with some of his old contacts and start up production of Methamphetamine. Dexter got Coleman a place in the Shady Creeks, Angel Pine forests below Mount Diablo. 
        They started up the production on small scale in one of the abandoned cabin. They stashed the prepared product into an auto shop owned by Club's friend. The product would then 
        be transferred to the city. This was one very dangerous operation but yet, Club had to take the risk. This was a bad idea since the start and club had to pay heavily for it. 
        This led to Dodger getting busted by Sheriffs while in possession of half a kilogram of narcotics substances. This was a felony and major parole violation for him, and hence 
        he got locked up for the remaining 15 years of his time.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="season3"><p><em>Dexter grew close with Eric Villain, one of the known Hispanic gang leader, operating from 103rd St. Inglewood. The gang was known as 103rd Rascals, 
        Inglewood. Dexter helped out them in a growing brawl with one of the African American gang lifting their head in the near by neighborhood Compton. Later on when some Irish 
        drug dealers tried to lay their foot in the drug trade, Pirates had threatened them to back down- which led them to kidnap one of the club's Prospect. Raskals and the Pirates 
        worked together in the process of liberating the Prospect- gunning down four of the Irish dealers.</em></p></div>
      
      <div class="season3"><p><em>A while after that, a rival MC riding by the name of Warlocks tried to fly colours in the Los Angeles. This led to Dexter personally stabbing one of 
        the Sergeant At Arms of the MC- and claiming his cut from him. That was the first event when Pirates have been territorial about the city, giving the signal of them going to 
        settle down as a full fledged California and Nevada charter eventually. Old Road Captain Jim Sturges was placed in charge of the second in command of the club in Dodger's 
        absence.</em></p></div>
